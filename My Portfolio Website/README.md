## 💡 What I Learned During This Project

Throughout this project, I focused on both design and technical skills, including:

- How to structure an HTML document properly with semantic tags
- Using **CSS `position` and `z-index`** to layer background images in the header section
- Applying **flexbox** and **flex-direction** to build responsive layouts
- Creating an **HTML table** to present education qualifications professionally
- Implementing responsive design techniques for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- Using **CSS Grid** for structured sections and advanced layouts
- Organizing project files clearly for maintainability

This project helped me understand how real-world websites are built and how small design choices impact user experience.
